Prep:

- This recipe should take 2 days - no more, no less, however, the curing process can be elongated, depending on time, to 3-4 days.

- TO CURE: Take Brown Sugar, and Salt - and rub the Pork Belly down thoroughly. Place in a Hotel Pan, SKIN SIDE DOWN, and let the sugar and salt begin drawing out moisture and breaking down the outside of the Belly. IMPORTANT: in the morning, when you come in for your shift the next day - TURN THE PORK BELLY OVER, SO THAT THE SKIN SIDE IS UP AND OPEN TO THE AIR. 

- Pre-Heat the Convection Oven to 325F/180C.

- Cover Pork Belly with remaining ingredients, and roast for 25 minutes. Then, turn the oven to 425F, and finish for and extra 10-15 minutes. 

- Once Pork Belly is cool, remove its skin layer and discard. Cut the meat, and prepare for next steps.

	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...

4. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the skillet. Once the butter is melted, add the onion, cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes.

5. Add the kale, garlic, thyme and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook out, stirring occasionally, until softened, approx 3 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons oil if the pan seems dry. Sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until flour is dispersed and lightly toasted, 2 minutes.

6. Stirring constantly, gradually add the stock and  cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. 

7. Mix in the parsnips, celery, potatoes, and the sautéed mushrooms and any accumulated juices. Cook untill potatoes and carrots are fork tender. finish with cream and reduce slightly.

Method:

1. In a large pot bring the water to a boil. Add the rice, lentils, bayleaf and 1/2 the salt. Bring back to a boil, turn heat down to medium and lid, leaving lid slightly ajar.
Simmer for 30-35 minutes or until the rice and lentils are tender. Drain, reserving at least 1 1/4 C (281g) of cooking liquid (it will be used later to make the sauce). Place the rice and lentils back in their cooking pot, lid and set aside off heat.

2. *A note about the veggies. Be sure they&apos;re diced small, otherwise they&apos;ll be crunchy-ish at the end of cooking. We&apos;re looking for them to be soft.

3. In a large Rondeau add the oil and heat until shimmering.  Add the bell pepper, onion and celery. Turn the heat to low. Stir. Cook, stirring occassionally for about 12-15 minutes. The veggies are done when the they&apos;re tender/soft and brown bits (fond – the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan) are just starting to appear in the pan. 

4. To the pan of veggies, add the tomato paste, garlic, Cajun or Creole seasoning and remaining 1/2  salt. Stir to coa the veggies. Pour in 3/4 C (180g) of the reserved cooking liquid from the lentils and rice. Stir.

5. To the pan, add the drained kidney beans. Stir. Heat should be on medium-low to low. Lid the pan and gently cook the beans through for about 8-10 minutes. Check on the beans a few times while cooking and If needed, add just a bit more cooking liquid from the reserved liquid. Your beans should be saucy, and moist, not dry.

6. Turn the heat to low and transfer the drained rice and lentils to the bean mixture. Add Worcestershire sauce. Add the lemon juice and to taste for seasoning, adjust if necassary;  then gently fold all the ingredients together.
If needed, to loosen the mixture or if it starts to get too dry, add a splash of cooking liquid - you&apos;ll probably not use it all - thats okay. Taste for salt. Lid. Leave on low heat for 3-5 minutes just to warm though, checking to make sure it isn&apos;t sticking - the pan should be almost dry, with a moist (but not sticky) rice mixture.

Method:

1. Place a large saute pan over a low to medium-low heat. Add the 1 /2 of the oil followed by onion &amp; garlic and reduce heat to low. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onions are golden brown.

2. Remove the onions from the pan and return the pan to the heat.  Add the spinach and cook until wilted.

3. Remove from the spinach from the pan and leave to cool.

4. Increase the heat to medium/high and return the pan to the heat. Add the remaining oil and place the cleaned mushrooms, top side down. Cook until lightly golden (approx 5 minutes) before turning over and cooking for a further 5 minutes or until golden. Remove from the heat, and drain on paper towel top side up as they will release a lot of liquid as they cool. 

5. Transfer the onions, spinach and mushrooms to the refrigerator and cool completely. 

6. Preheat the oven to 390F. On a parchment lined pan place the puff pastry sheet on top. Spread half the caramelized onions over the middle third of the pastry, making sure to leave an extra 2cm border at the edge of the pastry. Top with half of the baby spinach. Spread the dijon mustard over the mushrooms and season well with salt and pepper. Place the mushrooms on top of the spinach. Top the mushrooms with thyme and the remaining baby spinach and onions.

7. Very carefully roll the pastry over the top of the mushroom mixture until you have a log. Press down to seal the edges. Roll over the log so that the seam is facing the bottom.

8. Whisk eggs together to make an egg wash . Very lightly coat the outside of the pastry log with the egg wash. Place the pastry in the freezer for 10 minutes before repeating with another layer of egg wash and freezing the pastry for a further 10 minutes.

9. Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and flakey. Reserve for service.

1.Combine the barley and stock:  in a hotel pan. Add salt and pepper.

2.  Cook In steamer.  Keep an eye on the  barley as it will give off a lot of foam at first and can  boil over.

3. For pearl barley, start checking at 25 minutes. The barley is done when it has tripled in volume and is soft yet chewy. Add more water if the pan becomes dry before the barley has finished cooking; check every 5 minutes until desired chewiness is reached.

4. Drain the barley (if necessary): When the barley is done, it will have absorbed most of the water. If there is a little water still left in the pan, just leave the barley to sit for 10 minutes, covered, until it has all been absorbed. If there is a lot of water left, drain the barley in a strainer over the sink.

5. Fluff the barley!  With a fork, fluff the barley to separate the grains. this is an imprtant step with all our steamed grains!

IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.

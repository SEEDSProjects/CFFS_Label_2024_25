Method:

1. Zest and juice your 2 lemons.

2. Finely chop dill.

3. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

4. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

5. Fold all ingredients into one another. Taste for Salinity, Acidity, and add honey if the Sweetness needs a little kick.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

	<Recipe id="P-42817" image="">ALLERGENS: MUSTARD

Prep: 

1. Clean and cut Potatoes into large uniform shapes and sizes. Each Potato may yield 6 pieces, if cut properly - about the same style as Homestyle Potatoes. Steam these in the combi oven until soft but not crumbling apart - use the steam setting: check after 30 minutes.

2. Cut the Cauliflower into florets, and deep fry until golden brown - then set aside. Rough Chop Onions, and set aside your Ginger and Garlic. While you&apos;re doing this, set aside your spices - to be used at the beginning of the cooking process. Also, set aside your 4 litres of Water (though, it may not be necessary).

5. In the Tilt Skillet, starting with Canola Oil - start to saute your onions (towards caramelized). Then, throw in your spices, and saute them as well - before adding your Garlic and Ginger.

6. As soon as you add your Garlic and Ginger, you&apos;re going to want to deglaze the Tilt Skillet by adding up to 3 litres of the water you set aside. At this point you can add your Turmeric, Garam Masala, Mustard, and canned Tomatoes. 

7. Let simmer for a few minutes before adding the fried Cauliflower, and Potatoes. Turn up the heat on the skillet at this point, and scrape the bottom of the skillet with the mixing paddle to accumulate caramelized sugars therein that will burn if left unincorporated. Use the remaining water in this recipe, or more, if need be - keep it moving! You&apos;re near the end here.

8. Turn the temperature down on the Tilt Skillet. Rough Chop the Cilantro and Mint. Cut the Serrano Peppers thinly on a mandoline, and then throw all of these ingredients into the mixture. 

9. Season to taste at this point - the salt in this recipe is roughly 1.2% of recipe weight. You may find that you need more.

10. Finish with lime juice before serving. This could change depending on how you&apos;re doing your batches - but the finished product should be given acidity with lime juice prior to serving regardless of how this dish interacts with the Hot Holds.

	<Recipe id="P-43656" image="">ALLERGENS: MUSTARD

Prep:

- Weigh out all ingredients.
- Set aside Sugar and Salt.

- Toast all Spices / Seeds, until fragrant. This would be done at a higher heat that the next step. 
- Toast Split Peas separately - low heat.

- Mix all ingredients together, and take to the Vitamix. Grind into a fine powder.

Label / Date / Store Appropriately.

Note: when cooking with this, it&apos;s important to fry out the Split Pea in this recipe. It cannot be used simply as a spice mix like others - Baharat (which just means Spice in Turkish and a few other Middle Eastern dialects), Ras Al Hanout, etc. - it needs to be partially cooked. This does wonders for the spice elements. But, it also takes the grainy-ness out of the Split Peas (important).

Any questions, Ask Chef!</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44082" image="">ALLERGENS: WHEAT, GLUTEN

Prep:

- Take the Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Ajwain Seeds, Black Pepper and Garam Masala - and toast, then grind in the Vitamix into a fine powder. The toasting, as mentioned in other recipes, is key to developing flavour and aroma.

- Amchur Powder is not a spice, but a powder made of green mango. It should not be toasted. Opinions differ on this, but - for this recipe, do not toast this ingredient.

- Normally this recipe would be made into a paste with lemon juice and a small amount of water. We use this as a more dry rub, in combination with alread-wet ingredients like potatoes that have been boiled and chickpeas that sit in &quot;aqua fava&quot; (literally: bean water).

- If this spice mix is low, talk to a Chef about it. Some of these ingredients come from a specialty provider with an indented delivery schedule - and will need to be ordered several days in advance in order to allow for proper prep time.

Method:

NOTES: 
This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

1. Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

2. Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices(toast spices) Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with veg stock. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

3. Cut Paneer into bite-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off..

4.  Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

5.  Add the Cilantro. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Taste &amp; check for seasoning.

6. Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

7. Add Yogurt before moving this recipe intoserving pans. Reserve for service.

Notes: This recipe is all about timing. It can easily be done on the side, without hassle, while other recipes are in development. There are key areas that require direct supervision - the rest can be managed by raising or lowering heat, and intelligently employing different equipment to serve different functions throughout the recipe. 

Prep:

- Turn on the Tilt Skillet - as high as it will go.

- Soak Yellow Split Peas overnight. Soak in a stock if possible. IF you soak in a stock, place the stock and the split peas in a couple of shallow trays and throw them in the steamer. Ideal cook time: 2 Hours.

- Have your onions ready, as well as your 5 Spice Mix, and your Ginger and Garlic - BEFORE YOU ADD OIL TO THE TILT SKILLET.  Add oil, and immediately put your onions in there. You might want to even add some water to avoid burning if you have too much going on at once. Drop the temperature of the skillet to 350F/180C, and let simmer (if you added water), until there is almost no moisture left. 

- Add your 5 Spice and Garam Masala, and saute out thoroughly. Rememeber there is blitz&apos;d up Yellow Split Peas in the 5 Spice itself, so it needs toasting. After this, add your Butternut Squash, and deglaze with your water. You may need to add more water to this recipe - 10L should be considered the minimum.

- Raise the temperature of the skillet if you need to now, to make sure that you&apos;re boiling your Butternut Squash. It will take about 30-40 minutes to cook out depending on circumstances. Add your curry leaves, and Sprouted Pulses. Reserve Green Onions, Cilantro, and Kale until last for your Coconut Milk finish.

- At this point, check your Yellow Split Peas. They need to be done. They will likely be &quot;al dente&quot;, but that&apos;s OK. Add them to the mixture, and cook them with the Squash. They are now your indicator as to how you&apos;re doing - the Squash may finish before the Split Peas. 

- Season to taste. Add Coconut Milk VERY LAST, along with Cilantro and Green Onions. Check Seasoning.

Method:

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt.(Adjust if altering batch size).

2. Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to Robot coupe to pulse into a paste. Then, add to the pan with the onions.

3. Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.

4. Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt. If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (250 ml) water. You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.

5. Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.

6. When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, add more salt if needed.

7. Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix.

Hot hold/serve immediately

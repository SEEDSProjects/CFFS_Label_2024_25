- Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

Method:

1. Gather all ingredents. Using a larger pot than you think you will need (caramel expands and foams up once you add the cream to the hot sugar mixture) Caramel is a fast process and you cannot walk away from it. if you don&apos;t work fast once the sugar is ready, it will burn.Scale out all ingredents make sure the butter is cubed and cold.

2. Add Water and sugar to a heavy bottom sauce pan. turn on medium high heat DO NOT WALK AWAY. This recipe needs undevided attention.

3. Allow sugar to fully disolve. As the sugar melts, stir vigerously with a whisk or wooden spoon (nothing plastic or it will melt!) reduce heat once the sugar has fully melted.

3. once the sugar has melted stop stiring (you can swirl the pan but do not stir with a utensil)

4. As soon as the sugar turns to a dark amber colour, remove from heat and ad the cold butter, whisk until the butter is melted. Once butter is fully melted, add the heavy cream (using caution as hot steam will happen and the cream will foam up considerably) Whisk until smooth and homogenous(well blended) Let Cool! once cool enough to pour into a cambro do so, but let sit out without a lid until reaches room tempature.

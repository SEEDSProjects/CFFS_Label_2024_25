Method:

1. Zest and juice your 2 lemons.

2. Finely chop dill.

3. Process Cucumbers. These should be pulsed in the RoboCoupe. PULSED - NOT LEFT ON TO BECOME A SOUP. What you want is something about the consistency of a small dice. When this is done, transfer this mixture into a bowl with Cheese Cloth. RING OUT AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN. THIS WATER IS DELICIOUS. I RECOMMEND DRINKING IT FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE PROPERTIES. Unfortunately, it just doesn&apos;t belong in the Yoghurt in this recipe, as it would turn into Cacic.

4. Combine lemon juice and garlic. Let sit for 10 minutes. Salt this mixture to &quot;cook out&quot; the garlic as much as possible.

5. Fold all ingredients into one another. Taste for Salinity, Acidity, and add honey if the Sweetness needs a little kick.

NOTES: It&apos;s important to note that this is an opportunity for using old or slightly old Cucumber! For instance: look at the recipe for Taboulleh Salad Mix - Cucumber cores should be saved, and then processed and strained in Cheese Cloth for this recipe - otherwise it will be too watery.

In Turkey, there is a dish known as Cacic - a watery version of Tzatziki. The ingredients are more or less the same. What we know as Tzatziki is actually made with Labneh, which is pressed Yoghurt. Since we use regular Yoghurt in this recipe, we have to limit the amount of water content in it, otherwise it will be an undesirable AND low-quality product.

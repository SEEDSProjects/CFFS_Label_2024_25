Notes:

1. There are 11.36Kg in 25 Lbs. Cases of Chow Mein Noodles come from Fresh Point in 25 Lbs boxes. 

2. From Freshpoint we also get processed and unprocessed vegetables in 5 Lbs bags. This is why the &quot;Bean Sprouts&quot; and &quot;Julienne Vegetables&quot; are in those increments. 

Prep:

- Thaw Chow Mein Noodles if need be. If they need to be ordered, they can be ordered prior to 10:AM from Freshpoint for an afternoon (same day) delivery, but they will most likely come in frozen. It is best to thaw out these noodles a day in advance or more.

- If the noodles need to be thawed in a hurry, the Combi Oven and its steam setting can be employed.

- Once the Noodles are malleable, break them apart (they come in a large block), and tray them up on large Sheet Trays. Then, as evenly as possible, disperse the remaining ingredients over them for seasoning, flavour, and texture. 

- Steam again. Put into service trays - typically Hotel Pans or Half Hotel Inserts - and hold for service. It&apos;s best not to hold these for too long, however, of all of the starches - the Chow Mein does not degrade as quickly as others. That said - do not use this as an excuse to do off too much in advance.

Any questions? - Ask Chef...</Recipe>

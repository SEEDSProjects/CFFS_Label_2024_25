3. Add in the uncooked rice, and mix well with toasted spices, covering rice in the oil and flavour. 

4. Once the rice is fully coated in oil and toasted slightly add in veg stock, tomatoes and salt and pepper. Close the lid and bring to a simmer and cook 20-25 minutes, until rice is almost fully cooked but still a little firm in center. Stir every 5 minutes or so. Do not over cook the rice as this will need to be reheated and the rice will turn to mush.

5. Stir in bloomed saffron with rice. Steam the carrot, beans and cauliflower until just tender. Then fold in veg, potato, fresh mint, with the rice.

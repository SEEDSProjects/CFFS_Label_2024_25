- Once your Pork Butts are ready to prepare, score their tops (THE FATTY PART) with cross-hashed cuts up to 1CM deep, OK?!

- At this point, rub the Pork &quot;Butts&quot; with the dry spices (Cumin, Cinnamon, Cayenne +), salt, and achiote. The Achiote paste can also be mixed into a little bit of orange juice or pineapple juice to make it easier to rub in.

- In Deep Hotel Pans, place all of the butts in there with the Onions, Garlic, and wet ingredients (Water, Pineapple Juice, Orange Juice) - THEN - pre-heat your oven to 275-300 Degrees (F). 

The level of the wet ingredients should come halfway up pork, add more water if need be. Wrap with foi

	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

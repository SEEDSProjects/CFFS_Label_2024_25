METHOD:

Prep:

- This recipe should take 2 days - no more, no less, however, the curing process can be elongated, depending on time, to 3-4 days.

- TO CURE: Take Sesame Oil, Brown Sugar, and Salt - and rub the Pork Belly down thoroughly. Place in a Hotel Pan, SKIN SIDE DOWN, and let the sugar and salt begin drawing out moisture and breaking down the outside of the Belly. IMPORTANT: in the morning, when you come in for your shift the next day - TURN THE PORK BELLY OVER, SO THAT THE SKIN SIDE IS UP AND OPEN TO THE AIR. 

- Pre-Heat the Convection Oven to 325F/180C.

- Cover Pork Belly with remaining ingredients, and roast for 25 minutes. Then, turn the oven to 425F, and finish for and extra 10-15 minutes. 

- Once Pork Belly is cool, remove its skin layer and discard. Cut the meat, and prepare for next steps.

Prep:

- Cut all vegetables into large pieces. Do not spend more than 10 minutes cutting these vegetables, as all of them will be discarded, and no one will see your lovely cuts if you put effort into them.

- Heat a pot in the background with a small amount of oil. You can even start this process with water if you want. Start cooking out anything in the onion family first - this approach can be used with all stock making.

- Once you&apos;ve cooked out your onions (can no longer smell gas coming off of them, and you start to smell sugars coming from them), then add all remaining ingredients EXCEPT CILANTRO - as well as water - and bring to a boil. 

- When the pot is at a boil - let boil for about 20 minutes. Then, turn it down to a simmer. ADD CILANTRO (stocks and all), simmer for 40 minutes with salt, and take off heat. Once off heat, let rest for 45 minutes to an hour, and strain using the fine chinois.

Prep:

- Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

- In Deep Hotel Pans, place all of the butts in there with the Onions, Garlic, and wet ingredients (Water, Pineapple Juice, Orange Juice) - THEN - pre-heat your oven to 275-300 Degrees (F). 

The level of the wet ingredients should come halfway up pork, add more water if need be. Wrap with foi

	<Recipe id="P-44083" image="">ALLERGENS: N/A

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

PREP RECIPE

Assemble all ingredients.

1. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 

2. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.

3. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.

4. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.

5. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.

6. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.

7. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.

8. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

Prep:

- Garlic and Ginger - use the Pre-Minced products that are available in the prepped items fridge.

- Cut 1/3rd of a packet of Red Thai Chilis. Each packet that we get from Freshpoint is 300g.

- Large Dice: Cabbage, Onions, and cut Gai Lan in 

- Heat the Wok. This side can be done at the station for effect or in the back, in hiding. 

Either way --&gt; THIS IS AN ITEM THAT SHOULD NEVER SIT IN OUR WARMERS, AS IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE (WORSE THAN THE FACE THAT CHEF WILL MAKE IF HE FINDS IT IN THE WARMERS AT ANY POINT, OR BEING DONE AN HOUR BEFORE SERVICE), AND THE FLAVOURS WILL DEGRADE IMMENSELY.

- Starting with the Onions - in the hot Wok - begin to fry these ingredients. Spoiler - this is going to happen fast, and you&apos;re really just going to want to put some colour on the onions, before throwing in the Cabbage and deglazing with 2 Cups of Water. When you do this, throw in your Ginger and Garlic, and then toss your Gai Lan in. 

- Add remaining ingredients, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off heat at this point, and while it&apos;s still at a boil, make a Corn Starch Slurry out of your remaining Cup of Water in this recipe - adding it slowly while stirring. At this point, you&apos;re pretty much done. 

- It would be best to do this infront of the students, as it will draw attention to the amazing job you&apos;re doing and the flavours that you&apos;re representing.

Notes:

Sushi Rice is never made in a Combi Oven in Japan. That doesn&apos;t matter. It can be simulated well enough to a respectable standard. I would prefer to have this made in a Rondeau, with a higher water ratio than what&apos;s suggested in this recipe, however, when you use the steam function in the Combi Oven you have to use a 1:1 ratio because of the excess humidity in the oven&apos;s chamber. Timing on this will depend on how many times the oven is opened and closed during the cooking process relative to other items being prepped - a suggested number will be put forth below. 

Prep:

- Rinse Rice 3 times, or until the water from it becomes clear. In many cases, this will take more than 3 passes through COLD water.

- Once the Rice is cleaned, it should be drained effectively, and combined with its 1:1 water ratio for cooking. The steam function on our Combi Ovens, in case it isn&apos;t already going: 100% humidity w/ 212F/100C. Break up Lemongrass, and Slice up Ginger into chunks that you&apos;ll be able to take out after this process is over. DO NOT USE A GINGER PUREE for this recipe. Place the Rice in to steam.

- Combine Mirin, Rice Wine Vinegar and other ingredients into a bowl over ice. Or, place the bowl in the Freezer while the Rice cooks. THIS IS IMPORTANT, as it must help the rice cool down as much as possible, so as not to over-cook.

- Once Rice is cooked - 35+ minutes - take it out, and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the chilled liquid mixture, and mix around until evenly seasoned. BE CAREFUL NOT THE MASH IT UP. THIS IS EASY TO DO, AND WILL LEAD TO A STRANGE PRODUCT.

Note: 

This is a very simple recipe - combining one with the other. This will be a short write-up. 


Prep:

- Using the Wok, on high heat with the small amount of oil, mark the Beef enough to get a little taste of burning. Again, the colour here will be balanced out by the Bulgogi Sauce - go ahead and burn it a little bit.

- When you&apos;re content that you&apos;ve succeeded in giving the Beef a little burnt flavour, and that&apos;s it&apos;s cooked out, turn off the heat. As the wok is still hot though, add your Bulgogi Sauce, and let the temperature reduce until it&apos;s all ready to come out of the Wok as a mix.

- This is one of those things that you can get BONUS POINTS FROM CHEF for doing ON THE STATION during service or right at the beginning of service. It should NEVER BE DONE IN LARGE BATCHES PRIOR TO SERVICE IN A LARGE BATCH AND HELD HOT DURING SERVICE IN WASTEFUL BATCHES.

Method:

1.Place all your rice noodles in a deep mixing bowl, (trying to snap as few of them as possible as you remove them from the package). Bring a good amount of water to boil. Pour the boiling water over the rice noodles until they are completely submerged. 

2.  Stir constantly to prevent clumping/sticking. When they are completely limp, give them a taste to see if they’re cooked through. The thread-like vermicelli noodles  will cook through in just a few minutes. The flat rice noodles might take upwards of ten minutes depending on thickness. Pay attention and test the noodles frequently because they’ll become mushy if they overcook.

3. Once the noodles are tender, drain them and run them under cool water to stop the cooking. Toss them with a small bit of sesame oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other if you’re not going to use them right away. 

4. The noodles will be used in a stir-fry dish like pad thai, you definitely want to under-cook them a little bit. They will absorb more moisture and cook the rest of the way through once in the stir fry. If your noodles are perfectly cooked to start, they will turn to mush in the stir fry. 

NOTE: Even with a bit of sesame oil, the noodles still tend to clump up after you drain them. They will loosen again once you mix the noodles into your dish

Prep:

- Quarter Corn Tortillas. 2.5 Packages of Corn Tortillas will yield 2 Deep Hotel pans full of Corn Chips.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

- In Deep Hotel Pans, place all of the butts in there with the Onions, Garlic, and wet ingredients (Water, Pineapple Juice, Orange Juice) - THEN - pre-heat your oven to 275-300 Degrees (F). 

The level of the wet ingredients should come halfway up pork, add more water if need be. Wrap with foi

Prep:

- Basically, this is a bound gel of sweetened Tamarind Paste. 1 Jar is 300g, so the recipe is built around that.

- Fresh Tamarind, which isn&apos;t very widely available here in North America, is not very tart at all like Tamarind Paste. Citric Acid, other additives, and industrial processes force it to be this way - so it needs to be let out and sweetened. Allspice in this recipe is used to mask some of the bendinf that this ingredient must go through. 

- Place all ingredients into a Vitamix. Keep Xanthan Gum aside.

- Start the Vitamix, and slowly raise the speed setting until you&apos;re working with a fine mixture of all of the aforementioned ingredients. On &quot;High&quot; (the button to the left of the speed setting nob), remove the plunger from the pitcher base, and add the Xanthan Gum while the mixture is moving. 

- You should know, with this recipe, and all recipes requiring a binder like Xanthan Gum, how a thickener is doing in its job. To test this mixture, turn the Vitamix off, and dip the plunger into the mixture, then raise it to see how slowly it falls off the plunger. It should fall slowly. If it doesn&apos;t, add more Xanthan Gum binder, and continue. The idea is that this will become like a paste that will get things dipped into it.

- Don&apos;t worry - if you thicken it too much, you can always go backwards and let it out again, easily. This is not like over-cooking a steak. That said, know what you&apos;re looking for, and do it.

Utensils needed:</Recipe>
	<Recipe id="P-44933" image="">
Prep:

- Garlic and Ginger - use the Pre-Minced products that are available in the prepped items fridge.

- Cut 1/3rd of a packet of Red Thai Chilis. Each packet that we get from Freshpoint is 300g.

- Large Dice: Cabbage, Onions, and cut Gai Lan in 

- Heat the Wok. This side can be done at the station for effect or in the back, in hiding. 

Either way --&gt; THIS IS AN ITEM THAT SHOULD NEVER SIT IN OUR WARMERS, AS IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE (WORSE THAN THE FACE THAT CHEF WILL MAKE IF HE FINDS IT IN THE WARMERS AT ANY POINT, OR BEING DONE AN HOUR BEFORE SERVICE), AND THE FLAVOURS WILL DEGRADE IMMENSELY.

- Starting with the Onions - in the hot Wok - begin to fry these ingredients. Spoiler - this is going to happen fast, and you&apos;re really just going to want to put some colour on the onions, before throwing in the Cabbage and deglazing with 2 Cups of Water. When you do this, throw in your Ginger and Garlic, and then toss your Gai Lan in. 

- Add remaining ingredients, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off heat at this point, and while it&apos;s still at a boil, make a Corn Starch Slurry out of your remaining Cup of Water in this recipe - adding it slowly while stirring. At this point, you&apos;re pretty much done. 

- It would be best to do this infront of the students, as it will draw attention to the amazing job you&apos;re doing and the flavours that you&apos;re representing.

	<Recipe id="P-41574" image="">- PRE-SOAK Beans overnight!
   - 2 X 20L CAMBRO Containers
   - HALF of the Beans in Each
   - Filled with 12L of Water Each

- Drain Beans from their hydration liquid. Your cooking water should be different from your soaking water.

- Using the Small Steam Kettle, Cook Beans slowly in 20 extra liters of water. They should be good to start at 250F.


- Cook the beans until they are soft, but not decomposing. During the cooking process it is important to skim off the foamy protein that will accumulate at the surface of the cooking beans&apos; water - this, if unchecked, will lead to a poor bitter taste and a lesser shelf life for the beans themselves.

- While the beans are cooking, saute your onions in Canola Oil, until dark brown. Caramelize them as far as they will go, and then add Cumin and Garlic. Saute Cumin and Garlic for 5 minutes, and then take off heat.

- Turn off Steam Kettle when the beans are cooked, and let beans sit. Take 4L of the cooking water, and set aside.

- Drain beans, and then transfer them into a neutral container greater than 40L in volume. Get the large Hand Blender / Immersion Blender.

- Add the Onion mixture with the Garlic and Cumin, as well as half of the Salt. The remaining halves - set aside, and use to SEASON TO TASTE. 

- With the Hand Blender / Immersion Blender, blend about 4L of the bean mixture into a puree - and then add back into the rest of the beans, and mix. Add reserve liquid from the cooking, until you get - not a soup - beans with a puree of more beans.

- Using Paper Towel, create a large pan or bowl for draining the excess oil off of the Tortilla Chips, after they&apos;ve come out of the Deep Fryer.

- At 350 Degrees (F) in the Deep Fryer, fry NO MORE THAN HALF OF A STACK OF CORN TORTILLAS (QUARTERED) at a time.

- Using a Spider, or Long Tongs - KEEP TORTILLAS MOVING AT ALL TIMES. 

- Depending on how dark the Deep Fryer oil is, fry the Tortilla Chips until they are brown (keeping in mind that they will cook for a little while longer once they&apos;ve been taken out of the fryer. 

- As soon as the chips are out drying, salt lightly using the Windsor coarse grain salt. The salt will only stick during this stage of production - be sure to catch it!

1.Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 

2. Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?

3. Small Dice yellow Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

Notes: 

This is a simple roast for the Burrito Bar, Bueno - all you need to know is that the Butternut Squash is to be peeled, seeded, and chopped up before roasting. A processed product will not be used in this recipe. Whenever possible, use as much UBC Squash as possible, as there will be an excess of it during the Fall/Winter season to use. UBC Squash cost in the system has been actualized to equal Freshpoint&apos;s cost.


Prep:

- Pre-heat Convection Oven to 375F/190C. 

- Peel, Seed, and Chop Squash into 1&quot; Cubes.

- Toss in Canola Oil, Salt, and Spices.

- Roast for 25 minutes, and then check! Alternatively, these Squash cubes can be steamed for 25-30 minutes, and then tossed in everything - Spices, Oil, Salt, AND Garlic - AND THEN finished in the Convection Oven. 

- If you do not choose to steam the Squash beforehand, then only add the Garlic at the end of the roasting process - so as not to burn the Garlic.

- Roast until tender and cooked through - this will depend on the size of the cut / type of Squash - cool, and ready in the Bueno line in a hot-hold insert.

- Steam 2 Bags of the &quot;7 Bean Medley&quot; (Carb Freezer), and fold into the Roasted Squash as it cools.

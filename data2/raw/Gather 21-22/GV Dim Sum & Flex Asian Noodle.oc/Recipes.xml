PREP RECIPE

Assemble all ingredients.

1. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 

2. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.

3. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.

4. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.

5. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.

6. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.

7. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.

8. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

Label, date, refrigerate.</Recipe>

1.1) Split pork loin in to quarters lengthwise. Should have 4 tube like pieces. In shallow pan or bag marinate pork for 24 hours making sure it&apos;s fully covered by the marinade.

2) Remove from marinade and roast at 425F on wire racks on sheet pans until an internal temp of 165F is achieved. Reserve any pan drippings.

3) Allow the meat to rest.  Do not let rest for too long if slicing warm for service, try and have it ready about 30 mintues before service and make in batchs so you have fresh ones as much as possible to stop it from drying out.

Adversly: if slicing for Ramen: place pork on ice (with papewr below to keep it dry) until fully cooled. slice portions and line with burger patty paper to add to sopup for service.

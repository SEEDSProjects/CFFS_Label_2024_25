ðŸ”— [Presentation Slides](https://github.com/jlee2843/CFFS-22-23/blob/main/UBCFS/final_presentation.pdf)
- **Purpose**: Adhering to UBCâ€™s commitment to the *CAP 2030*, the CFFS project aims to achieve 50% GHG emission reduction by 2030 in comparison to 2019. 
- **Goals**: To develop a campus-wide Climate-Friendly Food Systems (CFFS) Label and observe consumer responses corresponding the labels. Ultimately aims to increase sustainable dietary choices and habits. 
- **Objectives**: Develop a semi-automatic flow that assigns CFFS labels based on the environmental impact of producing the item. 

This research consists of adaption and modification of Silvia Huangâ€™s pilot project, which was successful in assigning food labels at the Open Kitchen, Gather, and Mercente from 2019 to 2021 Summer. **Calculation metrics**, such as *impact baseline* for considered factors, are developed by Silviaâ€™s team in 2021 and is continued to be used for this study.

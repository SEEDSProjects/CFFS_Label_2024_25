Method:

1. Prepare all Mise En Place items that are dry, and combine. Sift together if you have time.

2. Add Egg, and 50% of the water, and mix with a whisk. 

3. Then, add the vinegar, and continue mixing. A chemical reaction will occur at this point between the vinegar and baking soda. 

4.If necessary, add the remaining water. Otherwise, do not, and let the mixture be by itself. It should be roughly the consistency of soft serve ice cream.

NOTE: This batter should be stored in the freezable containers in the Vegetable Containers, meant for squeeze bottles and other things that stand at room temperature.

[This is where I would normally write &quot;Label/Date/Store!&quot;, but since this is made several times per day, and never stored overnight - the container NOTE was written instead.]

Prep:

- THIS RECIPE IS A TOUGHT ONE; CRISPY SHALLOTS ARE AN ART FORM. PLEASE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY, AND GET CHEF TO DO THIS WITH YOU ONCE BEFORE TRYING IT ON YOUR OWN.

- Mandoline Shallots into thin rings - Approx. 2mm.

- Created a Salt/Water Brine at 10% salt (100g Salt: 1000ml Water). Soak mandolined Shallots in Brine for 10 minutes. Rinse once with clean water, and let rest for 20 minutes.

- At 325-350F, fry Shallots until golden. Shallots will continue cooking once you take them out - and set them on a tray lined with paper towel. IMPORTANT: as soon as you take the Shallots out of the fryer, and onto their blotting surface of paper towel, you will need to move them around so that they don&apos;t clump up and form balls or nests (which, once dried, will not come apart easy). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING A GOOD PRODUCT.

- Any questions (especially with this recipe, as the yield is low), PLEASE ASK CHEF!

PREP RECIPE

Assemble all ingredients.

1. Char onions, ginger, leek whites, daikon and cabbage in that order. 

2. While your veggies are charing, fill your kettle with 60L and pop in the Kombu and let it steep in warm water for 30 minutes. Take the Kombu out and save for Miso Soup.

3. Sautee your charred ginger and garlic. Add onions, leeks and celery.

4. Add sauteed veggies to the kettle and start filling with the rest of the water, leaving room for the Daikon and Cabbage. - Start heating up kettle to boil.

5. While the kettle is coming to temp, add Umami Dust - and any MUSHROOM ENDS that may be around. Some tomato ends are acceptable too.

6. Once the Daikon and Cabbage are done charring, cut into large chunks.

7. When Broth comes to a boil, turn it down to a very low simmer and add the daikon, cabbage and nori sheets. Season a bit at this stage too, as it helps draw out the flavour of the veggies.

8. If you are leaving the broth over night, you can add all the leek ends and any random cilantro/parsley/green onion ends to the broth while on low heat. If you are finishing it on the same day, then add the green ends at the end and let steep for 30 min before straining etc...

To finish.

1. Scoop all the veggies out.
2. Re-up with water and bring to a boil.
3. Turn down the kettle and add add 1 jug of soy sauce, taste and add more salt/pepper as needed.
4. Put through fine strainer and cool.

Label, date, refrigerate.</Recipe>

Note: as a general rule, it is best to put sauces on the Burrito right after the rice stage. If you put the sauces on last, or at the top (facing the customer) of the burrito - it will be a mess when you go to roll it.  It&apos;s a good technuique to put the cabbage, cheese, or arugula at the top of the burrito (facing the customer) before rolling it, as this will keep your hands clean, and help you save on glove waste.

- Drain Cannelini Beans. The Yield on these beans has been calculated in this recipe - roughly the loss of over a Kilogram in &quot;Aqua Fava&quot;. A quick rinse is valued, but not entirely necessary. 

- Half all Grape Tomatoes. You will notice in this recipe that 5 LBS is the measured amount require. This is because each box of Grape Tomatoes that comes in from Freshpoint is 10 LBS - meaning: use half of a box for this recipe. Easy enough?

- Small Dice Red Onions. Saute with Cumin and Cayenne, adding 1 Bag of Frozen Corn and Red Pepper to the mix along the way. Do not roast this Corn in the oven for any reason - its starches develop and it becomes tough texturally. Deglaze this mixture with Apple Cider Vinegar, and season.

- Pick Oregano. Don&apos;t bother picking the Cilantro, as some stem is fine in this recipe. Rough Chop both of these, and reserve to add into the rest of this recipe.

- Label / Date / Store Appropriately...


NOTE: This recipe will last if properly refrigerated for up to 5 days. This is a large batch for this item, since it&apos;s new to the menu and may not sell well depending on diner preferences. Do not make more than this until it&apos;s proven that it will move. Waste not want not!</Recipe>

Notes:

This recipe should be as green as possible - meaning: stewing the green elements of this recipe too far will kill the flavour and visual appeal of the recipe. The idea of this recipe is to have a flavourful earthy base to balance out the fats present in the Paneer (which is to be added last). 

Prep:

- Cut the root ends off of the Green Onions, and then grill them until coloured. Cool, and then chop up in pieces that are no less than 3 inches long.

- Rough Chop Onions, and begin cooking them out immediately. Throw in Spices, Garlic, and Ginger. Deglaze with water. Season and simmer for 5-10 minutes. 

- Cut Paneer into mouthful-sized cubes - nothing too big. It will cut like Tofu, but it will also flake off, as it does not have gypsum as a binder, and soy proteins are different from milk fat proteins.

- Add HALF of the Spinach in the recipe, and cover for 5 minutes. You want the Spinach to be cooked out, but not to the point of bitterness. At this point, the recipe is very close to being taken off heat.

- Add the Cilantro in this recipe. Then, using an Immersion Blender, puree the Spinach and its juices into a sauce. This does not have to be a uniform puree as it would come out of a Vitamix - a little bit of texture is OK. Check for seasoning.

- Add Chopped Green Onions (grilled), Paneer, the other half of the Spinach, and the Cilantro - season again to taste using the salt in this recipe. Turn off heat.

- Add Yogurt before moving this recipe into Hotel Pans for serving.
